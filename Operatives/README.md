# Operatives

Operatives is a game that I'm developing that is a story-based heist game. It will be similar to Entry Point and the Payday game series. I have provided three samples of code that are present in the lobby of the game.

- Atom-OPERATIVES-25112025.rbxm; A modified version of my Atom framework that contains some changes since the GitHub uploaded one, these changes will eventually be uploaded too once they've been finished. If you don't wish to download this file, please view the old version at https://github.com/crazyRBLX11/Atom-Framework.
- Client.lua; UI and Input script for the player character customisation, still heavily WIP. This requires Atom to work.
- Server.lua; Script that handles the actually customisation for the player, and eventually player teleportation, still heavily WIP. This requires Atom to work.
